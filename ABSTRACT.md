# VECTRA: Vehicle-Edge-Customer Temporal Routing Anticipation for Dynamic Vehicle Routing

Recent neural heuristics for the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW) often struggle to synchronize fleet behavior and anticipate the long-term impact of greedy local decisions, which are critical in highly constrained dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we introduce VECTRA, a Vehicle-Edge-Customer Temporal Routing Anticipation framework. Our approach employs a shared-policy architecture where each agent maintains a decentralized memory state to track fleet-level coordination within a sequential multi-agent decision process. We present a hybrid encoding strategy characterized by a graph encoder with radial distance bias and a specialized edge-feature encoder, each responsible for processing spatial relationships and temporal feasibility—such as time-window slack and capacity gaps—in distinct feature spaces. This design yields a more comprehensive representation of the trade-offs between immediate service and future fleet flexibility by explicitly fusing vehicle, edge, and customer representations. In the decision phase, an explicit ownership head and a neural lookahead head are used to compute coordination biases and cost-to-go estimates, facilitating stable path construction without combinatorial complexity. We train VECTRA using reinforcement learning in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on deterministic and stochastic DVRPTW benchmarks reveal that VECTRA outperforms established baselines, including traditional heuristics and recent DRL models, across diverse problem scales. Moreover, VECTRA demonstrates strong adaptability to uncertain delivery environments and rigid scheduling constraints. These findings confirm the effectiveness of VECTRA’s core design in solving difficult scheduling optimization problems.
